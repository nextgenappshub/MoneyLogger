      <h2>About the App</h2>
      <p>
        MoneyLogger – Private Finance Tracker is a comprehensive personal finance app that operates entirely on your device.
        It helps you track expenses and income, manage investments (including importing broker files such as Zerodha/Kite CSV),
        track loans/EMIs, set reminders and notifications, and analyze your financial data—all without sending any information to external servers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p><strong>We do not collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal data.</strong> The App does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or cloud sync.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No remote storage:</strong> All data (transactions, investments, loans, reminders, SMS-parsed entries) is stored locally on your device using on-device storage (e.g., SQLite).</li>
        <li><strong>No background uploads:</strong> The App does not send your data to any server controlled by us or third parties.</li>
      </ul>
